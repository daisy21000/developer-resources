## Introduction

Developer Toolkit is a web application built with Django to assist developers with helpful resources. This project has been built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 for the front-end and Python and Django for the back-end. Users are able to see resources as well as being able create, update and delete their own.

## UX Design

### External User's Goal

The user seeks resources to aid in web development with the ability to log in and add their own and favourite them for easy access. The user expects the website to be organised and responsive for all screen sizes.

### Site Owner's Goal

The site owner wants to create a website for developers to access helpful resources shared by fellow developers to aid them in their work. The information will be stored in a database and curated to ensure that all the content is relevant and appropriate.

### User Stories

The user stories for the project, along with acceptance criteria and tasks, can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/users/daisy21000/projects/8/views/1">project board</a>.

### Colours

I wanted a minimalistic design, hence I chose simple colours with a light grey for the background and a black for the text, the rest being button colours to make them stand out.

### Fonts

I used "Monserrat" for the body font as it is very readable and clean, and "Roboto Mono" for the heading font to give the website a unique look.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for the website were created using Balsamiq to map out the layout of the website and to visualize what it would look like. These wireframes served as a guide for the foundation of the website, ensuring the content was laid out in an organised way.

## Agile

This project was built following the Agile methodology throughout. Using the MoSCoW prioritisaion, the most essential features were first delivered to create the MVP. After that, the rest of the features were worked on based on their importance. The user stories were managed through a [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/daisy21000/projects/8) to keep track of the user stories and the current progress. Following the Agile methodology greatly enhaced development and allowed all important work to be done in a timely manner.

The user stories were labelled based on their importance:

- **Must Have** for important features that are essential for the project's MVP
- **Should Have** for important features that are not essential for the project's MVP but improve user experience
- **Could Have** for optional features that would enhance the project but should only be done if time allows

The project board contains all the user stories, as well as their acceptance criteria and tasks. You can find the project board here: [Capstone Project Board](https://github.com/users/daisy21000/projects/8)

## AI Implementation

I have used AI throughout the creation of this project to assist me with various different tasks.

### User stories

AI helped refine user stories and write acceptance criteria and tasks. I modified them to suit the project and implemented recommendations given about the user stories to make them more effective.
